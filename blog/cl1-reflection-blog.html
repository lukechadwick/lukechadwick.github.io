        <div class="question">What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</div>
        I like the compact, hands on, learn by doing experience.
        <div class="question">What are your impressions?</div>
        As above I think this learning style is better than doing a degree, at least for coding.
        <div class="question">How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</div>
        Effectively, though time will tell.
        <div class="question">Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</div>
        Not really, things have just been clarified from things like getting my hands on the materials and also watching the presentations of the graduates.
        <div class="question">Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</div>
        Really excited, not nervous, just ready to go.
