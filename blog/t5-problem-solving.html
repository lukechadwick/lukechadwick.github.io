			<h2>Technical Blog Part 5</h2>
			<h3>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h3>
			<h3>2 July 2018</h3>
			<p>
            <div class="question">Got blocked on a simple problem</div>
            <div class="question">Solved a problem in an elegant way, In both cases:</div>


            <div class="question">What was the problem?</div>
			I was using C# to write an application for a game that reads memory from the game executable and performs a few tasks based on this, however the application was crashing. 
			<div class="question">What problem solving techniques did you use?</div>
			First I tried double checking my code but couldn't see any obvious problems. After this I used a debugger which allowed me go through the code step-by-step to see where the data was going and what was happening to it.  This allowed me to locate and solve the error (Without going into too much detail the function I had that calculated a memory address was incorrect).
			<div class="question">How did you feel throughout the process?</div>
			Debugging can be quite stressful or time consuming, but I had done some before so not too bad.
			<div class="question">What did you learn?</div>
			Debuggers are a great way to take another look at your code and identify mistakes you might not see from simpler methods like looking at the console output or reading the source code.
