			<h2>Technical Blog Part 5</h2>
			<h3>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h3>
			<h3>2 July 2018</h3>
			<p>
            <div class="question">Got blocked on a simple problem, Solved a problem in an elegant way, In both cases:</div>


            <div class="question">What was the problem?</div>
			I was using C# to write an application for a game that reads memory from the game executable and performs a few tasks based on this, however the application was crashing. 
			<div class="question">What problem solving techniques did you use?</div>
			First I tried double checking my code but couldn't see any obvious problems. After this I used a debugger which allowed me go through the code step-by-step to see where the data was going and what was happening to it.  This allowed me to locate and solve the error (Without going into too much detail the function I had that calculated a memory address was incorrect).
			<div class="question">How did you feel throughout the process?</div>
			Debugging can be quite stressful or time consuming, but I had done some before so not too bad.
			<div class="question">What did you learn?</div>
			Debuggers are a great way to take another look at your code and identify mistakes you might not see from simpler methods like looking at the console output or reading the source code.
			
			<hr>
			<h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h3>

			<div class="question">Pseudocode</div>
			This is a good starting point before writing any actual code.
			<div class="question">Trying something</div>
			This usually follows Pseudocode and where you will usually find an problems initially.
			<div class="question">Rubber ducky method</div>
			Haven't heard or tried this method yet.
			<div class="question">Reading error messages</div>
			This is really helpful as the message is helpful in googling a solution
			<div class="question">Console.logging</div>
			Similar too the above method, though not always the best for complicated problems.
			<div class="question">Googling</div>
			The holy grail of problem solving for coding really, if you've got a problem you can almost be sure 10 other people do and have asked about/solved it.
			<div class="question">Asking your peers for help</div>
			If I really can't find a solution I'll try this, but I find I learn better if I solve it myself, and prefer to only be pointed in the right direction, rather than having the problem solved for me.
			<div class="question">Asking coaches for help</div>
			As above.
			<div class="question">Improving your process with reflection</div>
			I think this is a natural part of problem solving for me, once I have solved a problem I usually remember the process and will take it on board the next time I tackle a similar situation.
