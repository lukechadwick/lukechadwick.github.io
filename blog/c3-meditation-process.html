        <div class="question">What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important?</div>
        A responsive website is a website that dynamically scales to the size of the device that is visiting it. It's important that a website can scale like this so your website can reach as users on varied devices as possible and give them the best user experience possible.
        <div class="question">What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</div>
        Mobile first design works by designing the features that will be used on a mobile first, then developing more advanced features for tablets and PCs later. This is important because the web is shifting towards mobile devices being the majority so it makes sense to cater to these devices first.
        <div class="question">What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</div>
        Frameworks are intemediary type web languages that bridge the features of powerful languages and make them faster and easier to code for.  The pros are that you can get a website up and running faster and easier. This can make cost to the client cheaper by saving time.  These frameworks are also well supported by the community.
        The cons are that you learn the framwork rather than the underlying language which can hamper you as a developer when it comes time to use the language directy.  These frameworks may be also missing features that you would have to write yourself eventually, conversely they may come with features that you don't need, adding overhead and page load time. One more con is that popular framework websites like that made by bootstrap can look similar to other websites make using that framework and make lack visual originality.
        <div class="question">What a wireframe is and why we use it.</div>
        The wireframe serves as a visual guide or blueprint to represent what he website will look like. It lacks detail and only contains the most important parts, with fine details being added later. We use these as fast way to design the skeleton of a website, figuring out the finer details later.
